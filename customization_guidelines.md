# Customization Guidelines for the Restructuring & Consolidation Framework

This document provides guidance on how to customize the Codebase Restructuring & Consolidation Framework for specific project types, team structures, and organizational needs.

## Core Customization Areas

### 1. Technology Stack Adaptation

The framework should be tailored to the specific technology stack of your project:

- **Frontend Applications**:
  - Emphasize component architecture, state management, and UI consistency
  - Focus on bundle size optimization and rendering performance
  - Include specific patterns for the UI library/framework in use (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)

- **Backend Applications**:
  - Emphasize service boundaries, API design, and data access patterns
  - Focus on scalability, throughput, and resource utilization
  - Include specific patterns for the framework in use (Spring, Django, Express, etc.)

- **Mobile Applications**:
  - Emphasize platform-specific best practices and cross-platform considerations
  - Focus on battery usage, network efficiency, and UI responsiveness
  - Include specific patterns for the platform (iOS/Swift, Android/Kotlin, React Native, etc.)

- **Data-Intensive Applications**:
  - Emphasize data modeling, query optimization, and caching strategies
  - Focus on data integrity, processing efficiency, and storage optimization
  - Include specific patterns for data technologies (SQL, NoSQL, streaming, etc.)

### 2. Project Size Scaling

Adjust the framework based on the size and complexity of your project:

- **Small Projects** (< 10K LOC):
  - Simplify the analysis methodology to focus on key pain points
  - Reduce the number of phases in the implementation plan
  - Combine related tasks to streamline the process

- **Medium Projects** (10K-100K LOC):
  - Use the framework as designed with all sections
  - Balance depth of analysis with practical implementation time
  - Create clear milestones for incremental improvements

- **Large Projects** (100K-1M+ LOC):
  - Expand the analysis methodology with more detailed metrics
  - Break down phases into smaller, more manageable sub-phases
  - Increase emphasis on parallel processing and team coordination
  - Add more detailed validation checkpoints between phases

### 3. Team Structure Considerations

Adapt the framework to your team structure and organization:

- **Solo Developer**:
  - Simplify coordination aspects of the framework
  - Focus on technical improvements with highest ROI
  - Reduce documentation overhead while maintaining critical knowledge capture

- **Small Team** (2-5 developers):
  - Emphasize knowledge sharing and consistent patterns
  - Include pair programming sessions for critical refactorings
  - Balance immediate improvements with long-term architecture goals

- **Medium Team** (5-15 developers):
  - Add more structured coordination mechanisms
  - Include team-specific responsibilities in the implementation plan
  - Emphasize documentation and knowledge transfer

- **Large/Multiple Teams** (15+ developers):
  - Add detailed team coordination and communication plans
  - Include cross-team dependencies and integration points
  - Emphasize governance and architectural decision records
  - Consider creating specialized teams for different aspects of the restructuring

### 4. Business Context Adaptation

Tailor the framework to specific business contexts:

- **Startup Environment**:
  - Emphasize quick wins and immediate business value
  - Focus on areas that enable faster feature development
  - Balance technical debt reduction with feature velocity

- **Enterprise Environment**:
  - Add governance and compliance considerations
  - Include more detailed risk management and rollback plans
  - Emphasize documentation and knowledge transfer
  - Address integration with enterprise architecture standards

- **Regulated Industries**:
  - Add compliance verification steps to validation strategy
  - Include regulatory considerations in risk management
  - Document traceability between requirements and implementation
  - Add audit trail mechanisms for architectural changes

## Customization Process

Follow these steps to customize the framework for your specific needs:

1. **Assess Your Context**:
   - Identify your technology stack, project size, team structure, and business context
   - Document specific challenges and pain points in your codebase
   - Clarify business objectives and constraints for the restructuring effort

2. **Select Relevant Sections**:
   - Keep all main sections of the framework for consistency
   - Adjust the depth and detail of each section based on your context
   - Add domain-specific sections if needed (e.g., regulatory compliance, specific performance metrics)

3. **Customize Analysis Methodology**:
   - Add technology-specific analysis techniques
   - Include tools and metrics relevant to your stack
   - Adjust the focus areas based on your known pain points

4. **Tailor Restructuring Strategy**:
   - Adapt architectural patterns to your technology stack
   - Align module boundaries with your domain and team structure
   - Customize migration approach based on business constraints

5. **Adjust Implementation Plan**:
   - Scale phases and tasks to your project size
   - Align with your team structure and capabilities
   - Set realistic timelines based on available resources
   - Include team-specific responsibilities and coordination mechanisms

6. **Enhance Validation Strategy**:
   - Include technology-specific testing approaches
   - Add business-critical validation criteria
   - Incorporate existing quality assurance processes

7. **Expand Risk Management**:
   - Add risks specific to your technology and domain
   - Include mitigation strategies aligned with your organization
   - Customize rollback plans for your deployment environment
