  async login(username, password) {
    // Basic username/password authentication
    // No MFA, no token refresh, no session management
  }
  
  async register(username, password, email) {
    // Simple user registration
    // No email verification, no password policies
  }
  
  // Missing features: password reset, MFA, SSO, etc.
}
```
