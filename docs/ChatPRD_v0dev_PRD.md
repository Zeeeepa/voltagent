## Narrative

Sarah, a product manager at a fast-growing SaaS startup, needs to create a user onboarding flow for their new feature. With limited design resources and tight deadlines, she turns to ChatPRD on v0.dev. She opens the chat interface and types: "Create a multi-step onboarding wizard with progress indicators, form validation, and a welcome screen."

Within seconds, ChatPRD generates a beautiful, responsive onboarding component complete with step indicators, smooth transitions, and form validation. Sarah reviews the preview and asks for modifications: "Make the progress bar more prominent and add a skip option." The AI instantly understands the context and updates the component accordingly.

Impressed with the result, Sarah exports the code and shares it with her development team. The component integrates seamlessly into their React application, saving weeks of design and development time. The team can now focus on core business logic while maintaining a professional, polished user interface.

This experience transforms how Sarah approaches product development, enabling rapid prototyping and validation of UI concepts. The startup ships features faster, gathers user feedback sooner, and iterates more effectively, ultimately leading to better product-market fit and increased customer satisfaction.

## Technical Considerations

### UI Architecture

The ChatPRD interface leverages a modern React architecture built on Next.js 14 with App Router for optimal performance and SEO. The component hierarchy follows atomic design principles:

- **Atoms**: Basic UI elements using shadcn/ui primitives (Button, Input, Avatar)
- **Molecules**: Composed components like ChatMessage, ComponentPreview, and CodeBlock
- **Organisms**: Complex sections like ChatInterface, PreviewPane, and ExportModal
- **Templates**: Page layouts and conversation flows
- **Pages**: Route-level components with data fetching and state management

**Supported Frameworks**: Primary development uses React with TypeScript, but generated components support React, Vue 3, and Svelte. The system uses AST manipulation to convert between framework syntaxes.

**Component Libraries**: shadcn/ui serves as the primary component library, with fallback support for Material UI, Chakra UI, and Bootstrap when specifically requested.

**Styling Frameworks**: Tailwind CSS is the default styling solution, with automatic class optimization and purging. Support for CSS Modules and styled-components for legacy project integration.

**Animation**: Framer Motion provides smooth transitions and micro-interactions, with performance-optimized animations using CSS transforms and opacity changes.

### API & Backend

**Data Fetching**: Real-time chat functionality uses WebSocket connections for instant message delivery and component streaming. REST APIs handle component storage, user management, and export operations using tRPC for type-safe client-server communication.

**Authentication**: Clerk provides secure authentication with social login options (GitHub, Google, Discord) and magic link support for seamless onboarding.

**AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 powers the conversational interface with custom fine-tuning for component generation. Anthropic Claude serves as a fallback for complex reasoning tasks.

**Hosting & Deployment**: Vercel Edge Functions handle real-time chat processing with global distribution. Vercel KV stores conversation history and component metadata for instant retrieval.

**Database**: PostgreSQL on Vercel Postgres for relational data (users, components, conversations) with Redis caching for frequently accessed components and chat history.

### Performance & Scalability

**Optimizations**: 
- Component code generation uses streaming responses to reduce perceived latency
- Aggressive caching of generated components with CDN distribution
- Lazy loading of preview iframes and code syntax highlighting
- Service Worker implementation for offline component browsing

**Accessibility**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and high contrast mode. Voice input support for hands-free component description.

**Scalability Considerations**: 
- Horizontal scaling using Vercel's edge network
- Database read replicas for global component library access
- Rate limiting and queue management for AI API calls
- Component generation caching to reduce API costs

### Integration Points

- **v0.dev Platform**: Deep integration with existing v0.dev infrastructure for user accounts, billing, and component storage
- **GitHub API**: Automatic repository integration for component export and pull request creation
- **Figma API**: Bidirectional sync for design system documentation and component specifications
- **OpenAI/Anthropic APIs**: Primary AI providers for natural language processing and code generation
- **Vercel Analytics**: User behavior tracking and performance monitoring
- **Stripe**: Payment processing for premium features and subscription management

- **Strategy Pattern**: Multiple AI providers with fallback mechanisms

### Data Structures and Algorithms

**Core Data Models:**

```typescript
interface Conversation {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  title: string;
  messages: Message[];
  context: ConversationContext;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface Message {
  id: string;
  role: 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system';
  content: string;
  metadata: MessageMetadata;
  generatedComponent?: GeneratedComponent;
  timestamp: Date;
}

interface GeneratedComponent {
  id: string;
  code: string;
  framework: 'react' | 'vue' | 'svelte';
  dependencies: string[];
  preview: string;
  version: number;
  accessibility: AccessibilityReport;
}

interface ConversationContext {
  currentComponent?: GeneratedComponent;
  previousComponents: GeneratedComponent[];
  userPreferences: UserPreferences;
  designTokens: DesignTokens;
}
```

**Key Algorithms:**

1. **Context-Aware Prompt Enhancement**:
   - Maintains sliding window of last 10 messages for context
   - Extracts component references and modification requests
   - Builds enhanced prompt with relevant context and constraints

2. **Component Diff Algorithm**:
   - AST-based comparison for structural changes
   - Semantic diff highlighting for user feedback
   - Minimal change detection for efficient updates

3. **Framework Conversion Engine**:
   - Parse React JSX to AST representation
   - Apply framework-specific transformations
   - Generate equivalent Vue/Svelte syntax with proper bindings

**Performance Considerations:**
- Message streaming using Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
- Component caching with Redis for sub-second retrieval
- Lazy loading of conversation history with pagination
- Debounced preview updates to prevent excessive re-renders
