## Integration with Codegen

### Using the Template with Codegen

1. **Creating Feature Implementation Issues**:
   - Use the template when creating new feature implementation issues in Linear
   - Fill in all relevant sections to provide comprehensive context
   - Assign to Codegen for implementation

2. **Breaking Down Complex Features**:
   - Create a parent issue using the template for the overall feature
   - Create child issues for each implementation phase
   - Link child issues to the parent issue

3. **Providing Context for AI Assistance**:
   - Reference the template structure when asking Codegen for help
   - Provide as much context as possible from the template sections
   - Specify which section of the implementation you need help with

4. **Reviewing Implementation**:
   - Use the template sections as a checklist for review
   - Verify that all aspects of the feature are addressed
   - Ensure that acceptance criteria are met

### Example Codegen Prompt

When working with Codegen on a feature implementation, structure your prompt like this:

```
@codegen I need help implementing the [FEATURE_NAME] feature according to our Feature Implementation Excellence Framework.

## CONTEXT
[Provide relevant context from the template]

## CURRENT PHASE
We're currently in Phase 2: Core Implementation, specifically working on Task 2.1: [TASK_NAME].

## SPECIFIC HELP NEEDED
I need help with [SPECIFIC_ASPECT], particularly:
- [DETAIL_1]
- [DETAIL_2]
- [DETAIL_3]

## RELEVANT FILES
- [FILE_PATH_1]
- [FILE_PATH_2]
- [FILE_PATH_3]

Please provide implementation for [SPECIFIC_REQUEST].
```

This structured approach helps Codegen understand exactly what you need and provide more targeted assistance.
