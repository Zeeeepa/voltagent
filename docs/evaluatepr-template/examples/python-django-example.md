    - Model tests
    - View tests
    - Form tests
    - Utility function tests
  - Integration tests
    - API endpoint tests
    - View integration tests
    - Database interaction tests
  - Functional tests
    - User journey tests
    - Critical path testing
  - Test isolation and fixtures
    - Factory Boy usage
    - Test database setup
    - Mock and patch usage

### 6. Documentation Review
- Assess documentation quality:
  - Docstrings (Google or NumPy style)
  - README updates
  - API documentation (DRF Swagger/OpenAPI)

  - Settings organization
  - Reusable app patterns

## FEEDBACK CATEGORIZATION
Categorize each feedback item using the following schema:
- **Type**: Bug, Security, Performance, Quality, Documentation, Architecture, Testing
- **Severity**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Scope**: Specific file/line, Component, System-wide
- **Nature**: Blocking, Non-blocking but important, Suggestion

## FEEDBACK STRUCTURE
For each identified issue:
1. **Issue Location**: File path and line numbers
2. **Issue Description**: Clear description of the concern
3. **Impact Assessment**: Potential impact on system
4. **Improvement Recommendation**: Specific, actionable suggestion
5. **Code Example**: Example of improved implementation
6. **Reference**: Link to relevant documentation or best practice

## SUMMARY EVALUATION
Provide an overall assessment including:
1. **Strengths**: What aspects of the PR are well-implemented
2. **Areas for Improvement**: Key issues that should be addressed, ordered by severity
3. **Recommendation**: Approve, Request Changes, or Comment
4. **Next Steps**: Specific actions for the PR author
5. **Learning Opportunities**: Broader patterns or practices that could be improved

## DELIVERABLES
1. Comprehensive PR evaluation with categorized feedback
2. Specific, actionable recommendations for each issue
3. Code examples for suggested improvements
4. Overall assessment and recommendation
5. Prioritized list of changes required before approval

## ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
- This feature will be deployed to production immediately after merging
- Database migration performance is critical due to large table sizes
- The system has strict SLA requirements for API response times
- Backward compatibility must be maintained for external API consumers
- Security is a top priority as this feature handles sensitive user data

## PARALLEL PROCESSING STRATEGY
To efficiently evaluate this PR:
1. First scan all files for critical issues (security, database migrations)
2. Divide evaluation into models, views, forms, and utilities
3. Analyze database migrations separately for correctness and performance
4. Evaluate tests in parallel with implementation code
5. Consolidate findings into a unified evaluation
6. Prioritize feedback based on severity and impact
