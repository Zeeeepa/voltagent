# LinearParallel Template Customization Guidelines

This document provides guidance on how to adapt the LinearParallel Prompt Engineering Template for different team structures and project types. The template is designed to be flexible and can be customized to fit various organizational needs.

## Customizing for Different Team Structures

### Small Teams (2-5 Members)

For small teams, the focus should be on simplifying the structure while maintaining parallel workflows:

1. **Reduce Work Streams**
   * Limit to 2-3 parallel work streams to match team capacity
   * Focus on critical path items and core functionality
   * Combine related responsibilities to reduce handoffs

2. **Simplify Integration Strategy**
   * Schedule frequent (daily) synchronization points
   * Use pair programming for complex integration points
   * Reduce formal documentation in favor of direct communication

3. **Adjust Task Granularity**
   * Create slightly larger tasks (2-3 days) to reduce overhead
   * Emphasize clear task boundaries to enable parallel work
   * Assign multiple related tasks to the same team member

4. **Example Adaptation**:
   ```
   ### 2. Parallel Work Streams
   Define 2 parallel work streams that can be executed concurrently:

   #### Work Stream 1: Backend Implementation
   - **Purpose**: Implement core backend functionality
   - **Sub-issues**: [3-4 key backend tasks]
   - **Assignee**: @backend-developer

   #### Work Stream 2: Frontend Implementation
   - **Purpose**: Create user interface components
   - **Sub-issues**: [3-4 key frontend tasks]
   - **Assignee**: @frontend-developer

   ### 3. Integration Strategy
   - Daily synchronization meetings
   - Shared development environment for continuous integration
   - Direct communication for interface changes
   ```

### Medium Teams (6-15 Members)

For medium-sized teams, the standard template structure works well with some adjustments:

1. **Optimize Work Stream Division**
   * Create 3-5 parallel work streams based on functional areas
   * Assign small sub-teams (2-3 people) to each work stream
   * Designate a lead for each work stream to coordinate efforts

2. **Enhance Dependency Management**
   * Create detailed dependency graphs between sub-issues
   * Schedule regular cross-team synchronization meetings
   * Implement lightweight change management processes

3. **Balance Task Granularity**
   * Aim for 1-2 day tasks for optimal parallel execution
   * Create clear handoff criteria between dependent tasks
   * Include specific integration points in task descriptions

4. **Example Adaptation**:
   ```
   ### 2. Parallel Work Streams
   Define 4 parallel work streams with dedicated sub-teams:

   #### Work Stream 1: Core Services
   - **Purpose**: Implement foundational services and APIs
   - **Sub-issues**: [5-7 core service tasks]
   - **Team Members**: @dev1, @dev2, @dev3
   - **Work Stream Lead**: @dev1

   [Additional work streams...]

   ### 4. Cross-Team Coordination
   - Bi-weekly synchronization meetings for all work stream leads
   - Shared documentation for interface changes
   - Dedicated integration periods after major milestones
   ```

### Large/Distributed Teams (15+ Members)

For large or distributed teams, additional structure and coordination mechanisms are needed:

1. **Create Hierarchical Work Breakdown**
   * Define 4-7 major work streams with clear boundaries
   * Subdivide each work stream into feature teams
   * Implement formal interface contracts between teams
   * Designate integration coordinators for each major area

2. **Formalize Integration Processes**
   * Create detailed API/interface specifications before implementation
   * Implement formal code review and approval processes
   * Schedule dedicated integration sprints
   * Create comprehensive test automation for integration points

3. **Implement Robust Dependency Management**
   * Use visualization tools for dependency tracking
   * Create buffer time for critical path items
   * Implement formal change management for cross-team dependencies
   * Schedule regular dependency review meetings

4. **Example Adaptation**:
   ```
   ### 2. Parallel Work Streams
   Define 5 major work streams with dedicated teams:

   #### Work Stream 1: Data Services
   - **Purpose**: Implement data storage, processing, and access
   - **Feature Teams**:
     - Database Team: @db1, @db2, @db3
     - API Team: @api1, @api2, @api3
     - Processing Team: @proc1, @proc2, @proc3
   - **Work Stream Lead**: @data-lead
