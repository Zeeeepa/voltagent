# Progress Tracking & Reporting System Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Progress Tracking & Reporting System to track and visualize workflow progress.

## Features

- Milestone definition and tracking
- Progress metrics calculation
- Blocker detection and management
- Predictive analytics for completion estimation
- Customizable reporting
- Visualization data generation

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Run the example:

```bash
pnpm start
```

## How It Works

The example creates a sample workflow with five milestones:

1. Requirements Gathering
2. Design Phase
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Deployment

It then demonstrates:

- Registering milestones with dependencies
- Updating milestone states (completed, in progress, blocked)
- Calculating progress metrics
- Detecting and resolving blockers
- Generating predictions for completion time and risk assessment
- Creating a progress report
- Generating visualization data for charts

## Key Components

The Progress Tracking & Reporting System consists of several key components:

- **MilestoneManager**: Manages workflow milestones and their states
- **MetricsCalculator**: Calculates various progress metrics
- **BlockerDetector**: Detects and manages blockers in workflow progress
- **PredictiveAnalytics**: Generates predictions about workflow completion
- **ReportGenerator**: Creates customizable progress reports
- **VisualizationManager**: Provides data for visualizing workflow progress

## Customization

You can customize the system by:

- Defining your own milestones and dependencies
- Creating custom metrics calculators
- Implementing custom blocker detection logic
- Developing your own prediction algorithms
- Creating custom report templates
- Adding new visualization types

## Integration

The Progress Tracking & Reporting System can be integrated with other systems:

- Connect to event systems to automatically track progress
- Integrate with project management tools
- Feed data to dashboards and visualization tools
- Connect to notification systems for blocker alerts
- Integrate with scheduling systems for resource planning
