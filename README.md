# LinearParallel Prompt Engineering Template

## Overview

The LinearParallel Prompt Engineering Template is a comprehensive framework for generating parallel Linear issue structures that maximize team productivity through effective task decomposition and dependency management. This template helps teams break down complex projects into independently executable components that can be worked on concurrently.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following resources:

1. **[LinearParallel_Prompt_Template.md](./LinearParallel_Prompt_Template.md)**: The complete prompt template with detailed field descriptions and implementation guidelines.

2. **Example Implementations**:
   - [Example_Implementation_Authentication_System.md](./Example_Implementation_Authentication_System.md): Example for a modern authentication system implementation
   - [Example_Implementation_Data_Pipeline.md](./Example_Implementation_Data_Pipeline.md): Example for a real-time analytics data pipeline
   - The e-commerce shopping cart example is included in the main template document

3. **[Customization_Guidelines.md](./Customization_Guidelines.md)**: Guidelines for customizing the template for different team structures and project types.

4. **[Codegen_Integration_Instructions.md](./Codegen_Integration_Instructions.md)**: Instructions for using the template with Codegen.

## Key Features

- **Parallel Work Stream Design**: Identify independent tracks of work that can proceed simultaneously
- **Dependency Management**: Clearly document relationships between tasks and manage critical path
- **Task Granularity Optimization**: Break down work into optimal-sized tasks (1-2 days)
- **Integration Strategy**: Define clear integration points and testing approaches
- **Comprehensive Acceptance Criteria**: Establish measurable outcomes for each task

## How to Use

1. Start with the [LinearParallel_Prompt_Template.md](./LinearParallel_Prompt_Template.md) and review the structure
2. Examine the example implementations to understand how the template applies to different project types
3. Use the [Customization_Guidelines.md](./Customization_Guidelines.md) to adapt the template to your team structure
4. Follow the [Codegen_Integration_Instructions.md](./Codegen_Integration_Instructions.md) to implement with Codegen

## Benefits

- **Increased Team Productivity**: Enable multiple team members to work concurrently
- **Reduced Project Timeline**: Minimize blocking dependencies and idle time
- **Improved Visibility**: Clearly document dependencies and critical path
- **Better Resource Allocation**: Assign tasks based on skills and availability
- **Enhanced Quality**: Define clear acceptance criteria and validation approaches
