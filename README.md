# PlanTreeStructCreate Prompt Engineering Template

## Overview

PlanTreeStructCreate is a comprehensive prompt engineering template designed to generate hierarchical project plans with clear dependencies, milestones, and task breakdowns that enable effective parallel execution. This template helps teams create structured, executable project plans that maximize efficiency through proper task decomposition and dependency management.

## Key Features

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Creates a clear 3-level hierarchy (phases, components, tasks)
- **Dependency Management**: Explicitly identifies and documents all dependencies
- **Parallel Execution**: Optimizes for tasks that can be executed in parallel
- **Resource Allocation**: Maps skills to requirements and balances workload
- **Risk Management**: Identifies potential risks and develops mitigation strategies

## Repository Contents

- [**plantreestructcreate_template.md**](plantreestructcreate_template.md): The complete prompt template with implementation guidelines and parameter descriptions
- [**example_api_development.md**](example_api_development.md): Example implementation for an API development project
- [**example_mobile_app.md**](example_mobile_app.md): Example implementation for a mobile app development project
- [**example_data_migration.md**](example_data_migration.md): Example implementation for a data warehouse migration project
- [**customization_guidelines.md**](customization_guidelines.md): Guidelines for customizing the template for different team structures
- [**codegen_integration.md**](codegen_integration.md): Instructions for integrating the template with Codegen

## Getting Started

1. Review the [template structure](plantreestructcreate_template.md) to understand the components and parameters
2. Examine the [example implementations](example_api_development.md) to see how the template can be applied to different project types
3. Use the [customization guidelines](customization_guidelines.md) to adapt the template to your team structure
4. Follow the [integration instructions](codegen_integration.md) to use the template with Codegen

## Template Structure

The PlanTreeStructCreate template follows this high-level structure:

```
# Hierarchical Project Planning Framework v2.0

## ROLE
[Define the expert role and domain expertise]

## OBJECTIVE
[Define the project planning objective]

## CONTEXT
[Provide project context, requirements, and constraints]

## PLANNING METHODOLOGY
[Define the approach to planning including decomposition, dependencies, milestones, and resources]

## HIERARCHICAL TASK BREAKDOWN
[Create the 3-level hierarchy of phases, components, and tasks]

## PARALLEL EXECUTION STRATEGY
[Define how tasks can be executed in parallel]

## RISK MANAGEMENT
[Identify risks and mitigation strategies]

## IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
[Outline the sequential steps for implementation]

## DELIVERABLES
[List the expected project deliverables]

## VALIDATION STRATEGY
[Define how success will be validated]

## ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
[Include any other important factors]
```

## Example Use Cases

The PlanTreeStructCreate template is versatile and can be applied to various project types, including:

1. **Software Development Projects**
   - Web application development
   - Mobile app development
   - API and microservices development
   - Database migration projects

2. **Infrastructure Projects**
   - Cloud migration
   - Network infrastructure upgrades
   - Security implementation projects
   - DevOps pipeline creation

3. **Product Launch Projects**
   - New product development
   - Feature additions to existing products
   - Market expansion initiatives
   - Rebranding campaigns

4. **Organizational Projects**
   - Team restructuring
   - Process implementation
   - Training programs
   - Compliance initiatives

## Best Practices

1. **Customize for Your Needs**: Adapt the template to your specific project requirements and team structure
2. **Be Specific**: Provide detailed information for each parameter to generate more useful plans
3. **Validate with Experts**: Have subject matter experts review the generated plan
4. **Iterate**: Refine the plan based on feedback and changing requirements
5. **Balance Detail**: Include enough detail to be actionable, but not so much that the plan becomes unwieldy
6. **Focus on Dependencies**: Pay special attention to identifying and managing dependencies
7. **Consider Risks**: Thoroughly analyze potential risks and develop mitigation strategies
