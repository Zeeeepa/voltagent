```python
# Current batch-based data processing
# src/pipelines/batch_processor.py
class DataProcessor:
    def process_daily_batch(self, source_id, date):
        # Inefficient batch processing
        # No real-time capabilities
        # Limited error handling and recovery
        pass
    
    def load_to_warehouse(self, processed_data):
        # Basic data loading
        # No schema validation or data quality checks
        pass
    
    # Missing features: real-time processing, monitoring, data quality
```
