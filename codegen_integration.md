## ROLE
You are a senior software quality engineer with 10+ years of experience in Node.js and React, specializing in static analysis, security auditing, and performance optimization. You have deep expertise in identifying and remediating complex software defects in JavaScript/TypeScript applications.

## OBJECTIVE
Perform a comprehensive analysis of the authentication and user management modules to identify, categorize, and remediate all errors, vulnerabilities, and quality issues while providing detailed remediation plans.

## CONTEXT
**Repository**: https://github.com/organization/user-management-service
**Branch/Commit**: main (commit: a7b3c9d)
**Codebase Scope**: src/auth/*, src/users/*, src/middleware/auth.js
**Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JWT, React

...
```

### Step 2: Configure Analysis Parameters

In the main issue, provide specific configuration for Codegen:

```
## CODEGEN CONFIGURATION
- **Repository**: user-management-service
- **Analysis Depth**: Deep (include all dependencies)
- **Parallel Processing**: Enable (4 concurrent agents)
- **Tool Integration**:
  - ESLint with security plugins
  - SonarQube API integration
  - npm audit for dependency scanning
- **Output Format**: Linear issues with GitHub PR links
```

### Step 3: Prepare Repository Access

Ensure Codegen has proper access to the repository:

1. Verify Codegen has been installed on the GitHub repository
2. Ensure appropriate permissions are set for read access
3. If remediation is planned, ensure write access is also granted
4. Verify any required API tokens for third-party tools are configured

## Creating Linear Sub-Issues

### Automated Sub-Issue Creation

Instruct Codegen to create sub-issues for parallel analysis:

```
@codegen Please create the following sub-issues for parallel analysis:

1. Security Vulnerability Assessment
   - Focus: Authentication flow, JWT implementation, input validation
   - Tools: OWASP ZAP, npm audit, ESLint security

2. Performance Analysis
   - Focus: Database queries, authentication middleware, React rendering
   - Tools: React Profiler, MongoDB query analyzer

3. Code Quality Assessment
   - Focus: Error handling patterns, test coverage, documentation
   - Tools: ESLint, Jest coverage reports

4. Architecture Review
   - Focus: Component boundaries, service design, state management
   - Tools: Dependency graph analysis, complexity metrics
```

### Sub-Issue Template

Each sub-issue should follow this structure:

```
# [Analysis Category] for [Project Name]

## ROLE
You are a specialist in [specific expertise] with deep knowledge of [technology stack].

## OBJECTIVE
Perform a focused analysis of [specific scope] to identify all [issue category] issues.

## CONTEXT
**Repository**: [repo name]
**Branch/Commit**: [branch/commit]
**Specific Scope**: [files/directories]
**Parent Issue**: [link to main issue]

## ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY
[Specific methodology for this category]

## DELIVERABLES
1. Comprehensive inventory of [category] issues
2. Detailed remediation plans for each issue
3. Code examples for critical fixes
4. Integration with parent issue findings

## PARALLEL PROCESSING NOTES
- Coordinate with other agents via the parent issue
- Focus only on [category] issues
- Document dependencies on other categories
```

## Parallel Processing with Multiple Agents

### Agent Coordination

To enable effective parallel processing:

1. **Clear Boundaries**: Define clear boundaries between sub-issues to minimize overlap
2. **Communication Channel**: Use the main issue for cross-agent communication
3. **Dependency Tracking**: Explicitly document dependencies between analysis areas
4. **Shared Context**: Provide common context in the main issue

Example coordination instructions:

```
## AGENT COORDINATION GUIDELINES

- Each agent should focus exclusively on their assigned analysis category
- When finding issues that cross categories, document in the main issue
- Use the following format for cross-category findings:
  [CROSS-CATEGORY] [Brief description] - Relevant to [other category]
- Daily sync point: Add a comment to the main issue at 9:00 AM with progress
- Use consistent issue categorization schema across all agents
```

### Resource Allocation

Optimize resource allocation for parallel processing:

```
## RESOURCE ALLOCATION

- Security Analysis: Deep scan of auth/* directory first
- Performance Analysis: Focus on high-traffic endpoints first
- Code Quality: Prioritize core modules with highest change frequency
- Architecture: Begin with system-level analysis before component details

Estimated time allocation:
- Security: 40% of total analysis time
- Performance: 25% of total analysis time
- Code Quality: 20% of total analysis time
- Architecture: 15% of total analysis time
```

## Consolidating Results

### Aggregation Process

Define a clear process for aggregating findings:

```
## FINDINGS AGGREGATION PROCESS

1. Each agent will create a summary comment with their top findings
2. Main agent will consolidate all findings into a master inventory
3. Categorization will be normalized across all findings
4. Duplicate or related issues will be merged
5. Final prioritization will consider cross-cutting impact

Aggregation timeline:
- Individual summaries due: [date]
- Consolidated inventory due: [date]
- Final prioritization due: [date]
```

### Prioritization Framework

Provide a framework for prioritizing findings:

```
## PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK

Each issue will be assigned a priority score (1-10) based on:
- Security impact: 0-3 points
- Performance impact: 0-2 points
- User experience impact: 0-2 points
- Maintenance impact: 0-1 points
- Implementation effort: 0-2 points (inverse scale)

Priority tiers:
- Critical (9-10): Immediate action required
- High (7-8): Address in current sprint
- Medium (5-6): Address in next sprint
- Low (1-4): Add to backlog
```

## Remediation Automation

### Automated Fix Generation

Instruct Codegen to generate fixes for identified issues:

```
## AUTOMATED REMEDIATION GUIDELINES

For each issue with severity High or Critical:
1. Generate a code fix as a GitHub PR
2. Include before/after examples in the PR description
3. Add tests that verify the fix
4. Link the PR to the corresponding Linear issue
5. Request review from the appropriate team members

For Medium and Low severity:
1. Provide code examples in the issue
2. Create a separate PR for batched fixes when appropriate
```

### Verification Process

Define a process for verifying fixes:

```
## REMEDIATION VERIFICATION PROCESS

For each implemented fix:
1. Run automated tests to verify functionality
2. Perform security scan if security-related
3. Run performance tests if performance-related
4. Update documentation to reflect changes
5. Mark issue as verified in Linear
6. Document verification evidence (test results, scan reports)
```

## Advanced Integration Patterns

### Continuous Monitoring

Set up ongoing monitoring for similar issues:

```
## CONTINUOUS MONITORING SETUP

Based on the findings, configure:
1. Custom ESLint rules to catch similar patterns
2. GitHub Actions workflow for automated scanning
3. Pre-commit hooks for critical checks
4. Scheduled deep scans on a weekly basis
5. Alerts for regression or new instances of fixed issues
```

### Knowledge Base Integration

Create a knowledge base from the findings:

```
## KNOWLEDGE BASE INTEGRATION

For each category of findings:
1. Create a patterns and anti-patterns document
2. Develop code examples for training
3. Update team coding standards
4. Create quick reference guides for common issues
5. Schedule knowledge sharing sessions
```

### CI/CD Integration

Integrate findings into the CI/CD pipeline:

```
## CI/CD INTEGRATION PLAN

Based on critical findings:
1. Add security scanning to PR validation
2. Implement performance regression testing
3. Configure code quality gates
4. Add automated remediation for common issues
5. Create custom GitHub Actions for specific checks
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

Provide guidance for common integration issues:

```
## TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

Common Issue: Agent unable to access repository
Solution: Verify GitHub permissions and installation

Common Issue: Analysis taking too long
Solution: Narrow scope or increase parallelization

Common Issue: Conflicting findings between agents
Solution: Use the main issue for resolution and prioritization

Common Issue: Too many findings to address
Solution: Use the prioritization framework and batch similar issues
```

### Escalation Path

Define an escalation path for complex issues:

```
## ESCALATION PROCESS

If Codegen encounters issues it cannot resolve:
1. Document the specific limitation in the issue
2. Tag the appropriate team member for assistance
3. Provide all relevant context and attempted approaches
4. Continue with other analysis areas while waiting for resolution
```
