## EVALUATION METHODOLOGY

### 1. Code Quality Assessment
- Evaluate code against quality standards:
  - [QUALITY_STANDARD_1]
  - [QUALITY_STANDARD_2]
  - [QUALITY_STANDARD_3]
- Check for:
  - Readability and maintainability
    - Consistent naming conventions
    - Clear function and variable names
    - Appropriate comments and documentation
    - Logical code organization
  - Adherence to project conventions and style guides
  - Appropriate abstractions and design patterns
  - Comprehensive error handling and edge cases
  - Code duplication and complexity (cyclomatic complexity)
  - Modularity and separation of concerns
  - Proper use of language/framework features

### 2. Functionality Verification
- Assess whether the implementation:
  - Fulfills the requirements specified in related issues
  - Handles edge cases appropriately
  - Includes proper validation and error handling
  - Maintains backward compatibility (if required)
  - Integrates properly with existing systems
  - Follows business logic correctly
  - Addresses all acceptance criteria
  - Implements appropriate logging and monitoring

### 3. Security Analysis
- Identify potential security issues:
  - [SECURITY_CONCERN_1]
  - [SECURITY_CONCERN_2]
  - [SECURITY_CONCERN_3]
- Check for common vulnerabilities:
  - Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, NoSQL, Command, etc.)
  - Authentication and authorization flaws
  - Sensitive data exposure
  - XML/JSON parsing vulnerabilities
  - Security misconfiguration
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
  - Insecure deserialization
  - Using components with known vulnerabilities
  - Insufficient logging and monitoring
- Check for compliance with:
  - [SECURITY_STANDARD_1]
  - [SECURITY_STANDARD_2]
  - Industry best practices for secure coding

### 4. Performance Evaluation
- Assess performance implications:
  - Time complexity of algorithms and operations
  - Resource utilization (memory, CPU, network, disk)
  - Database query efficiency and indexing
  - Potential bottlenecks under load
  - Caching and optimization opportunities
  - Asynchronous operations handling
  - Resource cleanup and memory management
  - Connection pooling and resource sharing
  - Lazy loading and pagination implementation

### 5. Test Coverage Analysis
- Evaluate test coverage and quality:
  - Unit test coverage and quality
  - Integration test coverage
  - Edge case testing
  - Performance testing (if applicable)
  - Security testing (if applicable)
  - Mocking and test isolation
  - Test readability and maintainability
  - Test data management
  - Assertion quality and specificity

### 6. Documentation Review
- Assess documentation quality:
  - Code comments and docstrings
  - API documentation
  - README and other documentation updates
  - Architecture and design documentation
  - Usage examples and tutorials
  - Changelog updates
  - Deployment and configuration instructions
  - Troubleshooting guides

### 7. Architectural Alignment
- Evaluate alignment with architectural principles:
  - Consistency with system architecture
  - Appropriate use of design patterns
  - Service boundaries and responsibilities
  - Data flow and state management
  - Scalability considerations
  - Extensibility and future-proofing
  - Dependency management
  - API design and contracts

## FEEDBACK CATEGORIZATION
Categorize each feedback item using the following schema:
- **Type**: Bug, Security, Performance, Quality, Documentation, Architecture, Testing
- **Severity**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Scope**: Specific file/line, Component, System-wide
- **Nature**: Blocking, Non-blocking but important, Suggestion

## FEEDBACK STRUCTURE
For each identified issue:
1. **Issue Location**: File path and line numbers
2. **Issue Description**: Clear description of the concern
3. **Impact Assessment**: Potential impact on system
4. **Improvement Recommendation**: Specific, actionable suggestion
5. **Code Example**: Example of improved implementation
6. **Reference**: Link to relevant documentation or best practice

## SUMMARY EVALUATION
Provide an overall assessment including:
1. **Strengths**: What aspects of the PR are well-implemented
2. **Areas for Improvement**: Key issues that should be addressed, ordered by severity
3. **Recommendation**: Approve, Request Changes, or Comment
4. **Next Steps**: Specific actions for the PR author
5. **Learning Opportunities**: Broader patterns or practices that could be improved

## DELIVERABLES
1. Comprehensive PR evaluation with categorized feedback
2. Specific, actionable recommendations for each issue
3. Code examples for suggested improvements
4. Overall assessment and recommendation
5. Prioritized list of changes required before approval

## ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
- [CONSIDERATION_1]
- [CONSIDERATION_2]
- [CONSIDERATION_3]

## PARALLEL PROCESSING STRATEGY
To efficiently evaluate this PR:
1. First scan all files for critical issues (security, major bugs)
2. Divide evaluation into independent assessment categories
3. For each category, analyze relevant files in parallel
4. Consolidate findings into a unified evaluation
5. Prioritize feedback based on severity and impact
