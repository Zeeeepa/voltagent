## PARALLEL PROCESSING STRATEGY
To efficiently evaluate this PR:
1. First scan all files for critical issues (security, major bugs)
2. Divide evaluation into frontend and backend components
3. For frontend, analyze React components, hooks, and state management separately
4. For backend, analyze API endpoints, services, and database interactions separately
5. Consolidate findings into a unified evaluation
6. Prioritize feedback based on severity and impact
