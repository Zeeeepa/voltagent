          Protection Act (CalOPPA)

        <p>
          CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
          websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach
          stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the
          United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites
          collecting personally identifiable information from California
          consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating
          exactly the information being collected and those individuals with
          whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.
        </p>
        <p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>

            service providers to do the same. In some cases, deletion may be
            accomplished through de-identification of the information. If you
            choose to delete your personal information, you may not be able to
            use certain functions that require your personal information to
            operate.

            sell or rent your personal information to any third parties for any
            purpose. We do not sell your personal information for monetary
            consideration. However, under some circumstances, a transfer of
            personal information to a third party, or within our family of
            companies, without monetary consideration may be considered a “sale”
            under California law. You are the only owner of your Personal Data
            and can request disclosure or deletion at any time.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you submit a request to stop selling your personal information, we
          will stop making such transfers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note, if you ask us to delete or stop selling your data, it may
          impact your experience with us, and you may not be able to participate
          in certain programs or membership services which require the usage of
          your personal information to function. But in no circumstances, we
          will discriminate against you for exercising your rights.
